   - Default preferences in `user_preferences`
   - Welcome conversation in `chat_conversations`
4. User is redirected to subscription selection

### User Login
1. User signs in with credentials
2. System fetches user profile and subscription data
3. Routes user based on subscription status:
   - **Active subscription** ‚Üí Dashboard
   - **No subscription** ‚Üí Plan selection
   - **Past due/canceled** ‚Üí Payment required page

## üí≥ Stripe Integration

4. User completes payment on Stripe
5. Stripe redirects to `/checkout-success?session_id=xxx`
6. `process-checkout-session` edge function activates subscription
7. Database updated with active subscription
8. User redirected to dashboard

#### 100% Promo Code Flow
1. User applies 100% discount promo code
